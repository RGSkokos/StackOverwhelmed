As a user
of the StackOverFlow mock, I want to be able to give an upvote/downvote feature to
all comments so that the highest ranking comment can be seen first
and therefore be accepted to help the largest amount of people.

As a user
Every button implemented should be functioning statically (via javascript).
i.e: An upvote should increment the score by 1 in order to keep track of the best answer.

As a user
Our database must be able to reflect all changes made by the user in the front end.
i.e: If a comment has 4 votes and someone downvotes to 3 votes, our database should be able to see those changes in order to make 
sure front/back end systems works.
