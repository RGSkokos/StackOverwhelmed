As a user
I want a two features to upvote: one normal upvote and one super upvote
so that I can upvote or super upvote a comment.

As a user
I want to know the number of downvotes on a comment
so that I can know if the comment is trustworthy.

As a user
I want the most upvoted comment to be prioritized
so that I can get general idea of what most people think.
